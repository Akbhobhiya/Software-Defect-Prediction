# Software-Defect-Prediction
# A Model based on two main Algorithm KPCA and WELM used to detect defect in various datasets. 
# In this project we uploded complete code and Datesets that are used while implemented this.
# We have used five datasets mainly PC1, KC1, KC2, CM1, and JM1.
# we got different-2 accuracy on these datasets. These are the NASA datasets.
## Instruction to RUN:
